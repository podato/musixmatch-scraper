## Features:
* Shell arguments
* Clean-ish code :)

## Usage:
Before using the script you must install the requirements:

```
Upon installing the requirements you can just run the script normally
```

```
alternatively you could input custom arguments via shell
```
python3 main.py [musixmatch url] [output filename]
```

## TODO
* Download all songs from artists
* improved error handling
* automatic language changing for lyrics
* proxy support
